# Requirements

## Introduction
These days everyone is looking for automation and advancements in all the sectors. this system is capable of maintaining of heat in the vehicles seats.  
In our project, the sensor will sense is the driver has been seated or not and if the driver seated then he need to set the temperature accordingly. Based on that our controller will set the heater to required temperature. The Heater will generate the heat and a LCD display will show requested the temperature. 
## Features
- The System will sense is driver or passenger seated or not.
- Driver or Passenger has the access to modify the temperature in the vehicle.
- Low cost and robust system.
### Strengths
- User Friendly
- Easy to alter the temperature inside the vehicles.
-Low cost and Robust system.
### Weakness
- It is required so much implemention for normal temperature adjustment.
### Opportunities
- It can be implemented by having both Heater and AC.
### Threats
- Not suitable for average or high temperature places.
